This is a 2d pixel game that I am trying to develop using godot in my
free time.
The idea is that the player can interact with a rich 2d world and
explore it.

The whole game is pretty much in concept as of yet.

Current Version Details:
It only has a slime mob that tries to move in a random direction after
a set amount of time is passed.
